Deep Learning Malware Detection using Ember Malware Dataset
###########################################################

The project will focus on distinguishing between malicious and benign executable. To achieve this A Deep learning Binary Classification Model will be implemented through TensorFlow(Python). The Ember dataset will be used for this purpose. This dataset comes with a set of labeled data that will be used for and the training portion of the model. A testing set is also included that will be used to verify the correctness of the neural network. This NN will then be used to classify unlabeled data and compare against the results of the Ember classifier or a commerical antivirus program.
